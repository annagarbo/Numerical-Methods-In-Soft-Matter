## Second half of the course (A6–A14)

This folder contains the exercises developed during the second half of the
course *Numerical Methods in Soft Matter*, corresponding to assignments
A6–A14 of the official coursework.

In this part of the course, each assignment is organized in a dedicated
subfolder, reflecting the increased complexity of the numerical models
and simulations.

---

### Content

The exercises cover advanced topics in numerical and statistical physics,
including:

- Monte Carlo simulations of interacting systems
- Ising model and critical phenomena
- continuous-time Markov processes
- off-lattice particle simulations
- numerical integration schemes and thermostats
- Langevin and Brownian dynamics
- reweighting and histogram-based methods
- multi-particle and active matter simulations

---

### Organization

Each assignment folder typically contains:
- C source code for the simulations
- output data generated by the numerical models
- analysis and visualization performed using Python

---

### Notes

The material is intended to document the numerical modeling process and
the underlying physical reasoning, rather than to provide optimized or
production-ready software.
