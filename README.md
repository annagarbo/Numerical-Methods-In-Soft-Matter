## Numerical Methods in Soft Matter

This repository collects selected numerical exercises developed
during the course *Numerical Methods in Soft Matter*.

The focus is on implementing and analyzing stochastic and statistical
physics models through simulations in C.

---

### Topics covered

- Brownian and Langevin dynamics  
- Diffusion processes  
- Ising model and Monte Carlo methods  
- Analysis of numerical stability and time scales  

---

### Structure of the repository

Each folder corresponds to a specific exercise.
For each exercise, I include:
- a clean, final version of the C code
- a short README describing the model and the numerical approach

The original assignment is provided for reference.

### Notes

These projects were developed in an academic setting and aim to
demonstrate understanding of numerical modeling rather than
software engineering practices.
