# Numerical Methods in Soft Matter

This repository collects numerical exercises developed during the
course *Numerical Methods in Soft Matter*.

The work focuses on the numerical implementation and analysis of
stochastic and statistical physics models, with particular attention
to the connection between theoretical concepts and numerical behavior
observed in simulations.

## Course overview

The structure of this repository follows the organization of the
official course assignments, as described in the provided coursework PDF.

The material is divided into two main parts, corresponding to the
first and second halves of the course.

## Repository structure

### `prima metà esercizi/` — Introductory numerical methods (A1–A5)

This folder contains the material developed in the **first half of the course**,
corresponding to assignments **A1–A5** in the official coursework.

These exercises introduce the core numerical tools used throughout the course,
including:

- random sampling and Monte Carlo integration  
- inversion and rejection methods  
- importance sampling  
- discrete-time Markov chains and stochastic matrices  

In this part of the course, the material is **not strictly organized into
separate subfolders for each assignment**.
Instead, the focus is on the numerical workflow:

- numerical algorithms implemented in **C**
- output data generated by simulations (txt, csv)
- post-processing and visualization performed using **Python**
  (plots and Jupyter notebooks)

This organization reflects the learning-oriented structure of the first
part of the course, where different techniques are progressively introduced
and reused across exercises.

### `seconda metà esercizi/` — Advanced stochastic models (A6–A14)

This folder contains the material corresponding to the **second half of the course**,
covering assignments **A6–A14** listed in the coursework PDF.

Compared to the first part, these exercises involve more complex models
and a more articulated folder structure, with each assignment typically
organized in a dedicated subfolder.

Topics covered include:

- Monte Carlo simulations of the 2D Ising model  
  (Metropolis and cluster algorithms, critical phenomena)
- continuous-time Markov processes  
  (Gillespie algorithm, Lotka–Volterra and Brusselator models)
- off-lattice Monte Carlo simulations  
  (hard spheres and Lennard-Jones systems)
- numerical integration schemes and stability analysis
- interaction potentials and thermostat algorithms
- Langevin and Brownian dynamics
- reweighting techniques and histogram methods
- multi-particle Langevin simulations and active matter models

Each assignment folder contains the corresponding C code,
simulation outputs, and analysis material.

## Notes

The exercises were developed in an academic setting.
The purpose of this repository is to document the numerical modeling
process and the physical reasoning behind the simulations,
rather than to provide production-ready software.
