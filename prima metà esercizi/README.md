## First half of the course (A1–A5)

This folder contains the introductory exercises of the course
*Numerical Methods in Soft Matter* (assignments A1–A5).

The material focuses on basic numerical techniques such as sampling,
Monte Carlo methods, and Markov chains.

Exercises are organized around the numerical workflow
(C code → simulation output → Python analysis),
rather than in strictly separated assignment subfolders.
