## First half of the course – Introductory numerical methods

This folder contains exercises developed during the first part of the
course *Numerical Methods in Soft Matter*.

The focus is on building familiarity with numerical tools and stochastic
methods, starting from simple models and progressively increasing
complexity.

### Course contents

The material in this folder corresponds to the following topics
covered in the first half of the course:

- **A1 – Sampling**
  - Hit-and-miss sampling in D-dimensional domains
  - Inversion methods for non-uniform distributions
- **A2 – Sampling via coordinate transformations**
  - Uniform sampling in disks
  - Box–Muller transformation
  - Rejection methods
- **A4 – Importance Sampling**
  - Gaussian-like distributions
  - Numerical evaluation of integrals
  - Heaviside-type functions
- **A5 – Markov Chains**
  - Master equation and recurrence relations
  - Graph representations
  - Stochastic, irreducible and regular matrices
  - Stationary distributions

### Folder organization

In this first part of the course, exercises are **not strictly divided
into separate subfolders for each assignment**.

Instead, the material is organized around the **numerical workflow**:

- core numerical algorithms implemented in **C**
- output data generated from simulations (txt, csv)
- post-processing and visualization performed using **Python**
  (Jupyter notebooks and plots)

This reflects the actual development process followed during the course,
from low-level numerical implementation to data analysis and
visual interpretation.
